# HR-Analysis-IBM-
My First Power BI Dashboard.I work on IBM HR Analysis dataset from Kaggle. For creating these visualizations, I use Power Query Editor, DAX function, Add New Measure, Add New Column, Insert button (Education Field and Average Income), and Visual Interaction in Education Level.https://lnkd.in/gGnhUerZ
